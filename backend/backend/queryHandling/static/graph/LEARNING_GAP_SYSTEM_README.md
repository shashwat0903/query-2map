## How It Solves the Learning Gap Problem

### 1. **Gap Identification**
```python
# The system identifies what's missing
missing_prerequisites = [topic for topic in required_topics 
                        if topic not in completed_topics]
```

### 2. **Intelligent Clustering**
```python
# Groups topics by real-world scenarios
web_dev_cluster = ["array", "string", "hash_table"]
system_design_cluster = ["queue", "stack", "graph", "heap"]
```

### 3. **Optimal Path Generation**
```python
# Uses graph algorithms to find the best learning sequence
path = dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, current_knowledge, target_topic)
```

### 4. **Personalized Recommendations**
```python
# Tailors advice based on learner's goals and current level
recommendations = generate_recommendations(path, scenarios, learner_profile)
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Demo
```bash
cd dsa-scraper
python learning_gap_demo.py
```

### Advanced Analysis
```bash
python advanced_learning_gap_analyzer.py --target "t804" --completed "t729" --goal "practical"
```

### Find Available Topics
```bash
python find_topic_ids.py
```
